### Hello, world 👋

*"What's in a name"*, wrote Shakespeare once, 400 years ago. And people around me took it too seriously. Out of the hundred names I'm known by, Rajeshwari is officially on my passport (making it *official*, in case you missed it the first time), and **Gauri** is what I like to go by. My preferred pronouns are she/her/they.

Currently, I'm working on thinking what to say about me and my work here. So hold on, and I'll update you soon! 

Until then, visit me on my [website](https://rajeshwarisingh.com), which is also a work in progress. Story of my life. 🐣
